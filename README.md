Learnr tutorials on sampling, uncertainty and confidence intervals

These are a series of four tutorials writtin in learnr to teach undergraduates basic about sampling distributions, standard errors and confidence intervals. I'm making these avilable for anyone who wants to use them. They can be compiled easily into an R package in RStudio which means that, if a recent release of RStudio is used, they will appear in the "tutorials" pane when the package is loaded.
